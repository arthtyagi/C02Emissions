# C02Emissions
The data used is of Canadian cars and this Simple Linear Regression Model predicts the CO2 emission of a car with a
certain Engine Size.

Feel free to change the code to suit your needs or make the model predict CO2 emissions based on another critera. 
This model is based on Simple Linear Regression with just one independent factor and one dependent factor.

I will be building more Regression models for more interesting data. If you want this model to predict more,
feel free to create pull requests.
